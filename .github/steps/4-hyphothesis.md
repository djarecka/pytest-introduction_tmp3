# Week 4: Introduction to `hypothesis`

In this part, we will review `fixtures`, `test-driven development` and introduce `hypothesis`.

## 1. :book: Review fixtures
- read more about [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html) in the `pytest` documentation

## 2. :book: Test-driven development
- if you want to learn more about test-driven development, you can read [this post](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-test-driven-development)

## 3. :book: Introduction toproperty-based testing and Hypothesis
Hypothesis is a library for property-based testing. 
It lets you write tests which are parametrized by a source of examples, and then generates simple and comprehensible examples that make your tests fail. 
This lets you find more bugs in your code with less work.
- read more about [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## 4. :keyboard: :white_check_mark: Exercise 1: Using hypothesis
This week we will come back to the example from first 2 weeks. 
We will return to the original version of the code and use `hypothesis` to test the function.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update the repository in order to move to the next week/part of the course:
>  - After finishing all the exercises, create a Pull Request from the `week2` branch to the `main` branch
>  - Check the status of tests
>  - If all tests pass, merge the Pull Request, this should update a new `README.md` on the main page of the repository 
> (you can reload the page after 30-60s if you don't see the new content)
